# ETHICAL NN

Short experiment done in 2012 during my PhD research in Machine Ethics at the Royal College of Art to test if I could train a neural network with an ethical ideology.

You can find more information [here](http://www.medium.com/) about why I did that experiment.

The project was developed with [openframework](http://www.openframeworks.cc) 0.8 on MacOS and is using [ofxUI](https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI) for the GUI and the [fann library](https://github.com/libfann) for the neural network architecture.
